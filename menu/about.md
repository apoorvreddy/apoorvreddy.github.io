I'm currently a senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Walmart Labs, Bangalore][wm], where I am working on assortment optimization problems. Previously I was a research engineer at [Big Data Labs, American Express][amex] and  worked on cool things such as online learning for fraud prevention, representation learning using neural nets and outlier detection. In the past, I have worked on building NLP pipelines at [CognitiveScale][CogScale].
