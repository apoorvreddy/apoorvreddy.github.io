title: Welcome to My Blog !

I'm currently a research engineer at Big Data Labs, American Express and have worked on cool things such as online learning for fraud prevention, representation learning using neural nets and outlier detection. In the past, I have worked on building NLP pipelines at [CognitiveScale][CogScale].

Previously, I was a dual degree (B.Tech(Honors) + MS in Electronics and Communications Engg.) student at IIIT Hyderabad.

### Theme for this blog

I have used the awesome Jekyll theme called Lagrange available [here][Lagrange].
